# Welcome


This repo is a fork and modification from a repo by Zach Goldberg. As is often the case, my leadership style and experiences differ from his, and because of this, I made this repo my own. I encourage you to read his Handbook to see how different people approach similar problems.

Zachs Book:

Paperback: 978-1-955811-56-9

Ebook: 978-1-955811-57-6
